# [Exploring the world of software engineering in 2023 and predicting future 2024 trends](https://medium.com/@vaheedsk36/2023-software-engineering-safari-trailblazing-through-code-canyon-and-forecasting-2024-horizons-c4fb185d1eaa)

I think that this article is very insightful, as it describes key trends in the software landscape in 2023 and also forecasts 2024. These include the dominance of cloud computing for scalability and efficiency, a heightened focus on security due to increasing cyber threats, and the rise of automation and AI in streamlining software development. The article also noted that remote work continued to be prominent, and the open-source community saw substantial growth. The growth in open-source projects is an interesting insight, as it inspired me to look into gaining more experience through these communities. The article looks ahead to 2024 and shows trends like the demand for full-stack engineers, the growing importance of AI expertise, the rise of DevOps, and the emergence of low-code/no-code platforms. It is good to hear about this trend of increased demand during a time of massive layoffs. Challenges such as talent shortages, managing technical debt, and concerns over burnout were also noted, which alerts the need for adaptability and continuous learning in this evolving field.


Dear Johan,

Your post is a lot more optimistic than mine. Where I wrote about its been difficult for undergraduates to find jobs and internships, you rightly pointed out that there are several exciting new technologies emerging in tech that will expand the number of jobs on offer. It is probably still true that the long-term job market is promising, even if there are some bumps in the short term.
